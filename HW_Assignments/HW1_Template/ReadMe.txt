For RDB part, first connect to local mysql database. Then, each api just convert the dictionary to a string, a string that database manager could execuate. Then call pymysql's execuate API to execually execute the query. Any conflict would rasied by mysql database. 

For csv part, the core function is find_by_template, which is shown in the lecture. Then design a convert key to template function so that all params could be transfer to template. To check the uniqueness of primary key, I call panadas' api to check the file. So everytime the save() function is called, I would load again to make sure the query execuated is valid.
